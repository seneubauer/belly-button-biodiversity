### Goal
The purpose of this assignment was to show proficiency in using Plotly and d3.js to create and dynamically update a variety of displays. 

### Process
In order to properly import the specified data, I had to use the asynchronous ```d3.json().then()``` method and encapsulate the remainder of the code within it. Once the data was imported, it was simply a matter of parsing data to the correct objects and assinging those objects' required arrays to the graphs. The Demographic Info table was statically typed with dynamic links to the data. Another approach would be to create the rows dynamically with the data attached.

### Notes
I was unable to get the gauge plot to show a needle and display the step ranges within each step. Given that was not a requirement, I did not pursue too long without submitting. This way I can still figure it out without a deadline pressuring the process. I am pleased with the progress in designing HTML pages I've made; it is making more sense as I go. It shares similarities with WPF's XAML with which I am relatively experienced.
